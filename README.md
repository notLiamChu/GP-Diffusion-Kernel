# GP-Diffusion-Kernel
Basic code to get started with developing a Diffusion Kernel for GPyTorch

Notes:

I'm stuck on 2 things right now, which I believe are the primary issues with the coding errors:

1. Trying to figure out how to structure my input (x) and output (y) data.

2. Confused on what "categories" means and how to input the data.
